# VIX Calculation

The Volatility Index (VIX) measures 30-day expected volatility of the S&P500 index. Unlike conventional stock indexes, the VIX uses the prices of options to quantify anticipated market volatility. Part 1 of this project outlines a detailed procedure for calculating the VIX value for the S&P500 on January 2, 2015, following the formula and methodology specified in the VIX white paper.

## The VIX Calculation

The process of calculating the VIX involves several steps. The primary steps are as follows:

- Calculating the Mid-Quote price for each strike
- Computing strike price contributions
- Volatility Calculation for Near-Term and Next-Term Options
- Calculating the 30-day weighted average variance by combining the variances of near-term and next-term options
- Deriving the VIX by taking the square root of the average variance and multiplying by 100
